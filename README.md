- Ignore the quick setup and just hit OK

### Download Components 
- Componets in foobar are basically added functionality that you can add to your theme. You must download these for this theme to properly work. 
- First create a folder like, 'fbComponents' to keep all of the components organized and in one place for an easy install.
- It may look like much but once you finish installing, the 'hard' part is basically over!
- Simply download all files in the component folder in this repo or from the site itself. I will include all of the links to the component used here so you can read their functions more in depth:

- Ignore Biography and Library Tree for now.
  
### Installing Components 
- Once you have your components downloaded and stored, you are ready to actually install them. 
- Simply go to File > Prefrences > Components > Install
- Select all components in your folder and your components should be updated like this:

<img width="738" height="408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09508f15-50da-416c-b4f4-315181db127e" />

- Hit apply and foobar will restart itself to apply the changes.

### Preparing Biography and Library tree packages
- Since we installed the Columns UI component, upon start up we should see these choices.
- **Choose Columns UI**

<img width="587" height="257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/947d3afe-6b9e-49d5-ad64-2ccd8b9a0386" />

- Now that we are in Columns UI, we can continue installing Biography and Library Tree. 
- These use the Spider Monkey Panel (SMP) environment we just installed so lets try creating one.

- Click on 'Live Layout Editing' and right click a panel to add a SMP like so:

<img width="816" height="717" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0914bb0b-df4b-4687-b756-5ae131644dcd" />


- Here is what it should look like:

<img width="840" height="417" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1d1351e-2854-4e87-96bf-1d5aee04d80e" />


- Now that we have a SMP we can finish installing Biography and Library Tree.
- First, deselect 'Live Layout Editing'

<img width="188" height="87" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37e74379-277a-4e7c-a879-d0d0d6b1d6c8" />

- Now, Right click the SMP and hit 'Configure panel..'
  
<img width="374" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/144642e4-c5ff-4ce0-8f3f-010b6175f64b" />

- Now go to the 'Script' tab and click 'Packages'. You should now be in the menu to import both Biography and Library Tree

<img width="496" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33181016-2870-4962-bfa8-f21f6b3f0590" />

<img width="165" height="102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37afedd1-79ea-4abd-baef-648a1f0b0e40" />

- It should now look something like this:

<img width="502" height="473" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c5e6e6c-09f9-4a77-b7ed-f36bf6f54767" />

- Now just to make sure they are working properly, we should test them before we import the theme.
- Make sure your media libaray to pointing to your music folder. File > Preferences > Media Library > Add Folder and Apply

- Follow the same steps above! Live Layout Editing and right click to add another SMP
- Deselect Live Layout Editing and right-click to configure panel.
- Add Biography or Library Tree!

<img width="731" height="821" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbb41ead-b2f2-4943-abbd-7bf78621876c" />

<img width="684" height="711" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a53352d-a6f6-457c-ba17-3d3d5a38cd6d" />

- Biography and Library installed successfully:


<img width="728" height="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96d2e0c2-e955-48c5-a6f0-58ebdd3d5ebe" />

- We can finally import the theme

### Importing Theme 
File > Preferences > Columns UI > Import Configuration...

<img width="521" height="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec687dc5-c46c-45f2-a479-50c801a723ef" />

<img width="434" height="423" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac083d5-9a80-43b8-9827-cf44edaf4b2d" />

- Select OK

- You may notice a pop up of 'Slideshow no valid images found!' Nothing is wrong, this is just my Dynamic image panel script telling you that there are no images specified yet. Close it and we can go back to it once we finish setting the theme up. 

<img width="731" height="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0793a001-9948-4305-a145-b47ce827c468" />

- Looks odd but we just need to tweak it a bit.
- If you are still on light mode make sure to change it to dark
- File > Preferences > Display > Columns UI > Colors and Fonts > Dark mode

<img width="446" height="272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c61300d-b979-4d8d-98c5-86de501411b0" />

<img width="718" height="408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa6aa35-365e-4193-9113-814355316f0b" />

- Now the colors are accurate! But where are the rest of the panels? 
Some of the panels are collasped and just need to be adjust to your screen. Since my theme was made on a 24in monitor, my small laptop doesnt have enough screen for that so we need to adjust with the dividers. 

- Pull this divider out:

<img width="690" height="462" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc8c476-a12a-4430-8268-ae30a4e218b5" />

- Also adjust this by pulling down:

<img width="475" height="307" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bde23dba-069e-4bd9-9c06-d2ed9b5f76cc" />


- Our playback controls are also hiding so pull that up
  
<img width="708" height="195" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eeed5c7-99ee-450e-b717-8e53319fda37" />

- The top panel as well to reveal the visualizer:
 
<img width="719" height="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/913162e0-b022-4f15-9afb-f7742f9ae3c9" />

- After adjusting:
  
<img width="732" height="717" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add7fdec-2efc-439f-97ef-344a4b98ee40" />

- However, we should remove the top toolbar as it is mostly redundant as the theme already includes the file menu, playback buttons, device selector and playback order.
- Remember, the foobar icon is a SMP script. It does the same functions as the toolbar above

<img width="344" height="227" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6066f3d-fb87-4845-b227-50a459cf6dfc" />

- Go to preferences > Display > Columns UI > Main Window and uncheck 'Show Toolbars'

<img width="688" height="548" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30bba23-d5b6-4cd3-8472-04398f0d0e3e" />

- Much cleaner!

<img width="736" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/401d2f22-a3d8-49f6-9adc-0dbbdfd31d9a" />

## Icons, Waveform, Control Panel Fixes

<img width="736" height="161" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d0806d9-3669-4d03-8e94-9bc320412d71" />

- There are still issues with the waveform bar and icons why?
- Just like the panels, we need to just adjust the waveform bar. And for the icons, we simply just need to download a few fonts.
- I have already included all of the fonts in the repo. Simply download the raw files and place them into your folder.
- Here are the links for the fonts as well:
  
**Webdings 1-3:**
- https://github.com/justrajdeep/fonts/blob/master/Webdings.ttf
- https://github.com/justrajdeep/fonts/blob/master/Wingdings%202.ttf
- https://github.com/justrajdeep/fonts/blob/master/Wingdings%203.ttf

**Guifx V2:**
- https://www.dafont.com/guifx-v2-transports.font

**Fontawesome:**
- https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beakerbrowser.com/blob/master/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf

**Microsoft Segoe Fluent Icons font:**
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/downloads/#fonts

- Once you downloaded them, here is how it should look like:
<img width="328" height="265" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5e2f22b-2d98-409f-bd18-9e72fbf3eb32" />

- No need to unzip
- To install them, simply double click on the zip file and open the TTF

<img width="714" height="523" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fa3dd5d-71b6-4f2e-b76e-5dbc8e55c12b" />

- Then Click 'Install'

<img width="708" height="395" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b60c6004-dad6-40cb-81a6-ee67d4695f88" />

- Then proceed to open the TTF files and install the rest of the files like so!

<img width="648" height="507" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/146d44c5-7ec2-4e7b-b57e-d8978f3a08a1" />


- After you install the fonts, **Restart Foobar**
- After restart:

<img width="332" height="76" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcf724b3-fb47-4809-8824-ee4a38dd009d" />

- Our icons are now working!

#### Waveform Minibar
Now for the final step is to adjust the waveform mini bar.
